### History

Buld Then Snip, LLC. was founded in October 2012. The company successfully launched [Build and Shoot](http://buildandshoot.com), a community for the game Ace of Spades in response to Jagex obtaining the rights to the game and publishing another version under the same name. The three founders, Daniel Chiles, Nate Shoffner, and 'izzy' were staff members of the original game, trailing back to April 2011. Build and Shoot's objective was to provide a safe harbor for the 'classic' game.

### Name
The name "Buld Then Snip" is an intentional misspelling that is based off of a meme that started within the early Ace of Spades community where somebody [created a clan](http://forumarchive.spadille.net/topic.php?id=930&view=all#post-9809) by the same name. Parody clans soon followed and quickly became a part of the game's lore.
